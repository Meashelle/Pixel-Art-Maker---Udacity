The Project Details

In this project, we are given a starter template. Using this template, I'm building the script to do the following:

Upon form submission, build the grid.
The form provides the number of rows (via the grid height) and columns (via the grid width).
The grid is a <table>.
Upon clicking on a single grid square, color that square's background color to the currently selected hex color.
Build it with JavaScript (not jQuery).
